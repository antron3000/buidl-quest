# BUIDL-QUEST

This is a hackathon project for Eth Waterloo 2023.

### What is BUIDL QUEST
Buidl Quest seeks to incentivize cross collaboration among hackathon teams at Eth Waterloo, and help unlock the maximum buidling potential of ETH Waterloo as a whole. 

### The Problem

Hackathon teams work in silos. Many teams struggle with the exact same problems, but don't share solutions. Large bounties are out of reach for many beginner teams.

### How we will do it
**Tokenization of Prize Winnings** - 
We will create a platform that will let hackathon teams create a token that represents their prize winnings. Our team included. 

**Simple Bounty Platform.** - 
Hackathon teams can post bounties in their token, to help solve problems or perform general tasks. Any hackathon participant can perform these bounties. 

Each team is free to decide how to allocate their token.

At the end of the hackathon, teams will distribute their prizes to token holders as an honor based system.
